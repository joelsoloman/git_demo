# Hello world

1 -> git init (Only once when creating the repo from scratch)

            if you want to remove then delete the .git in the Directory

# Status

2 -> Git Status to check the status of the repo

3 -> Git Add <filename> --- Adds the files for you to commit

4 -> git commit -m "message" ---- commits the file

# Tips

git branch - shows current branch

use . instead of <filename> to add everything

git log --oneline --decorate - Gives the information of the commits

git checkout -b add-files

This helps in creating a new branch || dont use -b if not creating

Making another change by editing and commiting again
